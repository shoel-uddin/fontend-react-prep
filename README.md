## Closure

- a nested function that has access to outter function variables
## Callback

- agument that is a function

### does it have to be an arrow function?

Nope!

### does it have to be an anonymous function?

Sometimes...
## Promises

- for organizing asynchoronous code
- they solved the problem of "callback"

- it's an object
- with a `.then()` function
    - pass it a callback function
- and it has a .catch() function

- it's an object 
- it exists in one of three states
    - pending
    - fulfilled
    - rejected
